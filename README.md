# Pokemon-Game
Hey! This is a game to mimic the original Pok√©mon game's on Nintendo and making it into a web application free for anyone to and play. Your character can explore the island and fight other wild pokemon!

Currently, I am still working on this game so the code that is commited has not fully been functional, I will be adding new things everyday at 12 a.m. EST so please keep update on the js files. I am using vanilla js as my framework for this project. Used a tad bit of css and some html code as well. 

I hope you can enjoy this game and play whenever you are bored!
